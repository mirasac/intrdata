# Keywords
- average number of UMI per cell: measure of quality in single-cell RNA sequencing where the number of Unique Molecular Identifiers (UMIs) is considered.
- clonal frequency statistics: statistics of number of clonotypes in the immune repertoire of a subject or a population.
- clonotype: set of T-cells having the same antigen receptor.
- donor: biological subject supplying the sample of lymphocytes.
- empirical Bayes approach: procedures for statistical inference in which the prior probability distribution is estimated from the data.
- expanded clonotype: higly duplicated clonotype due to activation after being activated by dendritic cells which exposed the corresponding antigen.
- Hill diversities: measures of diversity in a complex system.
- gDNA dataset: genimic DNA sequencing data.
- grid search: tuning technique that attempts to compute the optimum values of hyperparameters.
- log fold-change: measure of increasing or decreasing of a system between two consecutive steps (e.g. time instants).
- [longitudinal](https://www.scribbr.com/methodology/longitudinal-study/) repertoire sequencing (RepSeq): repertoire sequencing performed on the same group through the duration of the study.
- RÃ©nyi entropies: log of Hill diversities.
- same-day replicate: experiment part of a set of experiments executed in the same conditions the same day.
- TCR read counts: T-Cell Receptor (TCR) counts resulting from a sequencing experiment.

# Notes
- One thought and possible application: see in the distribution what are the similar expanding clonotypes and use the data to create similar sequcences to create vaccines that can activate responses also for those signals, to create vaccines able to affect also possible similar variants of a same threat.
