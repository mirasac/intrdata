# Keywords
- clonal frequency statistics: statistics of number of clonotypes in the immune repertoire of a subject or a population.
- clonotype: set of T-cells having the same antigen receptor.
- donor: biological subject supplying the sample of lymphocytes.
- expanded clonotype: higly duplicated clonotype due to activation after being activated by dendritic cells which exposed the corresponding antigen.
- gDNA dataset: genimic DNA sequencing data.
- [longitudinal](https://www.scribbr.com/methodology/longitudinal-study/) repertoire sequencing (RepSeq): repertoire sequencing performed on the same group through the duration of the study.
- TCR read counts: T-Cell Receptor (TCR) counts resulting from a sequencing experiment.

- same-day replicate
- Hill diversities
- empirical Bayes approach
- differential expression model
- naive log fold-change
- DNA immune repertoire sequencing
- expansion dynamics with strong selection
- average number of UMI per cell
- cell carrying a clonotype
- RÃ©nyi entropies
- grid search

# Release
- One thought and possible application: see in the distribution what are the similar expanding clonotypes and use the data to create similar sequcences to create vaccines that can activate responses also for those signals, to create vaccines able to affect also possible similar variants of a same threat.
- The required length is 2 to 3 pages, figures and tables included. I can always change the size and organisation of the page to fit this limit, e.g. by using a larger 2-columns page layout (use class option `twocolumn`).
- Remove formula if not nedded in the end.
