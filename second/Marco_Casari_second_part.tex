The article introduces a probabilistic model able to estimate the noise and describe clonotypes expansion in longitudinal Repertoire Sequencing data (RepSeq).
Next Generation Sequencing (NGS) provides large amounts of RepSeq data, which standard inference methods fails to describe accurately due to experimental noise and biological diversity. Many factors contribute to the noise: some are related to the experiment execution (e.g. sampling procedure, library preparation), others have biological origin (e.g. gene expression). These factors introduce variability in sequence counts which is not related to the natural variability of T-Cell Receptors (TCRs).

The model presented in the article is able to decouple the noise distribution from the clonotype counts distribution, learning parameters of both from RepSeq data. Additionally, once the parameters are learned, a Bayesian approach can be used to ...

% MC the model is composed by three building blocks.
% MC explain also the noise: The noise is over-dispersed with respect to Poisson distribution, hence a different model is considered, tipically a Negative Binomial (NegBin) distribution.  greater dispersion than Poisson distribution Noise is not described by the Poisson distribution, hence a different ...

% MC the model can then be used for inference.

% MC how they validate their inference experiment using the model.

\subsection{Modeling repertoire variation}
The model consists in three main parts, identified by the noise model, the clone size distribution $\rho(f)$ and the dynamical model $G(f', t'|f, t)$.

% MC explain in detail the characteristics of each distribution.

The noise model $P(n_i|f_i)$ is a conditional probability of cell counts $n_i$ of the $i$-th clonotype given the true frequency $f_i$. This definition is necessary because frequencies $f_i$ are not known, since RepSeq experiments supply a cell count for each clonotype and it is a noisy function of the frequency.
Index $i = 1, \dots, N$ is a label to identify each clonotype, with $N$ total number of clonotypes in the immune system. This value is not known either, the total number of counts $N_\mathrm{read}$ is used instead.%
\footnote{Clonotype index is omitted when the meaning of variables is clear.} % MC remove this footnote is useless.

Three functional forms has been selected for the noise model: Poisson distribution, negative binomial distribution and a two-step model. Poisson distribution is set with mean $\bar{n}_i = f_i N_\mathrm{read}$ but it is not effective in reproducing observed noise because of its smaller variance. The negative binomial distribution has mean $\bar{n}_i$ and variance $\bar{n}_i + a \bar{n}_i^\gamma$ % MC continue...

To build the model, three steps are involved, one for the characterisation of each model part.

% MC explain here the steps done to find the parameters, the one for noise is explained in the next section.
